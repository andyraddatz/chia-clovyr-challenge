# chia-clovyr-challenge

## ideas

- jukebox
- bottom-up deferment voting system "vouchcoin"
    - people either vote directly, or commit their vote to someone they trust to vote in their interest
    - leads to organic politician emergence via individual vouching/committing votes to another person
    - somehow anonymize and allow changing vote or commitment at any time up until whatever decision is made
- proof-of-having-been-somewhere somehow, physical meatspace kiosks hidden in remote places or at coffee shops etc
    - perhaps encrypted data gets unencrypted while in a location
- white/blacklistcoin, can white/blacklist certain addresses from ever receiving XCH originating from this coin
- system of additive coin-based approvals
  - see https://chialisp.com/docs/common_functions#outer-and-inner-puzzles
  - assumption that "puzzle hash" can be a specific coloured coin
  - think power rangers and megazord
- ethical browser shopping extension
  - establish support chains explorer to discover who you are supporting when purchasing
    - Unilever, foreign companies, Haliburton, etc
      - if your purchases are lining billionaire piggy banks maybe you'd just like to know that at least
    - monetize ideas
      - charge xch to automate research and/or automatic purchasing
      - companies pay to be verified by x (any chia address)
        - establish authority or verility how?
        - how will we anonymize/decentralize so that companies don't corrupt us or it won't matter
- alternating, toggling CAT coin logic...  parent coin ID = certain CAT, then != certain CAT, then =...
- open DAO, cooperative organization (co-op), vote deferment

## zoom questions

- does `run` basically mean build from Chialisp -> CLVM?
- currying = passing in functions as arguments?

## notes

- existing coins can be referenced like libraries by puzhash
